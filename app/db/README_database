DEPENDENCIES:
-------------
* mysql
* python
* python-mysqldb

additionally, to have a web interface to use mysql:

* phpmyadmin

-- in ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client python-mysqldb phpmyadmin 

CREATE DATABASE, TABLES AND INSERTS:
------------------------------------

SQL files: compmusic_mysql_script.sql + inserts.sql

1st) in phpmyadmin:
enter as a root, create database called "compmusic", then click on privileges and 'Add a new user' to have access to read/write in this database.

Let's say you created user compmusic with pasword xxxxx (it means your own passwd) 

2nd) then in a terminal (ubuntu):
mysql -u compmusic -p compmusic < compmusic_mysql_script.sql
mysql -u compmusic -p compmusic < inserts.sql

If everything went fine, you already have your MySQL database filled with MusicBrainz data.

-----------------

Now you can start using DAO.py
Open the script, go to the bottom and see in the __main__ some examples.
The work is still in progress.
